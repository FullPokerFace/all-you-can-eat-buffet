### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented
- [ ] **AI Integration**: API currently returns placeholder responses
- [ ] **Database Integration**: MongoDB setup exists but not connected
- [ ] **Conversation History**: Basic structure exists but needs persistence

### ðŸ“‹ To Do
- [ ] Connect AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to process questions
- [ ] Implement conversation persistence with MongoDB
- [ ] Add user session management
- [ ] Enhance error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add conversation export/sharing features
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and security measures

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js App Router)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React patterns
- **State Management**: React useState for local component state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color scheme and responsive design
- **Components**: Modular UI components with consistent design system

### Backend (API Routes)
- **Endpoint**: RESTful API using Next.js API routes
- **Method**: POST requests for chat interactions
- **Data Flow**: User question â†’ API validation â†’ AI processing â†’ Response
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with status codes

### Data Layer (Prepared)
- **Database**: MongoDB connection utilities prepared
- **Models**: Basic structure for conversation storage
- **Security**: Environment variable configuration ready

## Development Setup
